		<h2>The Birth of Share The Signal</h2>
		<p class="h3">
			Our story begins with a moment of inspiration. After attending a business
			meeting where a district attorney shared harrowing insights about human
			trafficking, our founder, Don Meredith, couldn’t shake the urgency of the
			issue. Later that night, at 1:30 a.m., he had a dream—a vision of a world where
			people could recognize the often-hidden signs of trafficking and act to prevent
			it.
		</p>
		<p class="h3">
			Determined to turn this vision into reality, Don reached out to (Ret.) Navy
			Pilot LCDR Doug Lito, who shared his passion for social change. Doug, also an
			actor in Hollywood, immediately saw the potential in Don’s idea. Together, they
			recognized the need for a simple, yet universally recognizable, civilian
			distress signal—something that could be taught, understood, and used by anyone
			in a crisis.
		</p>
		<p class="h3">
			The project quickly gained momentum. Doug connected with a film crew in
			Coronado, California, and together, they brought the idea to life. This
			collaboration marked the birth of our organization, Share The Signal.
