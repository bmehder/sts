				Our story begins with a moment of inspiration. After attending a business
				meeting where a district attorney shared harrowing insights about human
				trafficking, our founder, Don Meredith, couldn’t shake the urgency of the
				issue. Later that night, at 1:30 a.m., he had a dream—a vision of a world
				where people could recognize the often-hidden signs of trafficking and act to
				prevent it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Determined to turn this vision into reality, Don reached out to (Ret.) Navy
				Pilot LCDR Doug Lito, who shared his passion for social change. Doug, also an
				actor in Hollywood, immediately saw the potential in Don’s idea. Together,
				they recognized the need for a simple, yet universally recognizable, civilian
				distress signal—something that could be taught, understood, and used by
				anyone in a crisis.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project quickly gained momentum. Doug connected with a film crew in
				Coronado, California, and together, they brought the idea to life. This
				collaboration marked the birth of our organization, Share The Signal.
