		<p>
			At Share The Signal, our mission is simple yet powerful: to reduce the number
			of human trafficking cases by raising awareness and educating communities about
			the signs of grooming and trafficking. We believe that through education, we
			can empower individuals to take action—whether it’s recognizing a distress
			signal, identifying suspicious behavior, or sharing information with others.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our ultimate goal is to create a ripple effect. By educating one person, we
			create a chain reaction that can spread throughout communities, ultimately
			leading to fewer cases of trafficking and more lives saved.
