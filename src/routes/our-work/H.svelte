		<p>
			The fight against trafficking is far from over, and we’re just getting started.
			With our signal now in eleven languages and growing, we're taking our mission
			global. Our next steps include:
		</p>

		<ul class="list flow">
			<li>
				<strong>Expanding Educational Outreach:</strong> We’re developing more content
				to educate parents, teachers, and communities about the signs of grooming and
				how to intervene early. Our goal is to make this information accessible to every
				household.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Leveraging Technology:</strong> We’re integrating AI and data analytics
				to identify trafficking patterns and provide law enforcement and NGOs with the
				tools they need to act faster and more effectively.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Community Engagement:</strong> We plan to host more workshops, webinars,
				and events to engage local communities, empowering them to be vigilant and proactive.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Global Partnerships:</strong> We’re forming alliances with international
				organizations to tackle trafficking on a global scale, ensuring that our signal
				reaches every corner of the world.
