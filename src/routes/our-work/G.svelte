				In 2022, we formalized our efforts, becoming a 501(c)(3) organization. Our
				founders—Don Meredith, Shawn Barrieau, and Jessica Holland—have been
				instrumental in driving our mission forward. Don Meredith has become a
				prominent voice in the fight against trafficking, speaking at community
				events, rotary clubs, and even Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Shawn Barrieau,
				with his background in venture capital, brings a visionary approach to
				expanding our impact.

				Jessica Holland, our Director of Marketing and Co-Founder, has been pivotal
				in leading us into the future. Under her guidance, we’ve embraced new
				technologies and launched the “Be the Force of Change” initiative, creating
				content that directly addresses the grooming and manipulation tactics used
				against vulnerable young women. Brenda Meredith, our Treasurer, ensures that
				our financial resources are managed with precision, allowing us to grow
				sustainably and maximize our outreach.
